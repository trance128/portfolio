Discovery Cafe
---------------

Discovery Cafe is a real project which is in use by a local coffee shop.
The cafe was in need of a new till system - something to allow them to take orders,
print receipts, store previous orders, calculate takings etc.
They are a small cafe with a single windows tabled used for their till, therefore all
file could live and run from a single system.

This is a complete web app, using Django as a back end and with REST to integrate React for
the front end.
Further, a mobile version was made in React Native, but it isn't currently in use therefore
it has not been extensively tested.
