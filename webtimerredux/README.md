Simple Web Pomodor Timer; coded by Ovidiu Mazuru, as a portfolio project.

This project made with Redux to demonstrate it's use, although this is a premature optimization: usually
state data would be saved in components for a simple project such as this.

This project uses fat reducers, though the logic could easily be moved to components instead.
Presentational only data is stored in component's state.

Style was done in flexbox, in a way to easily port to React Native.
The same project is also made in React Native.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
