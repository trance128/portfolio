A simple movie search database, as coded by Ovidiu Mazuru as a portfolio project.

This project aims to demonstrate use of external API's, as well as async redux through the
use of the thunk library.

Although a case could be made for using simple state data rather than redux in
such a simple project, redux was chosen to emulate a larger project.

The external API used is the open movie database, found at www.omdbapi.com
