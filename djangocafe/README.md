Discovery Cafe.
This project was made for a friend who needed a new till system at their cafe.

Project is coded only in Django, using their templating language, as this was made before
I learned React.

I'm in the process of recreating this project in Django + React, and will upload that once done.
In the mean time, I wanted to show that I can work in Django and Python more generally.
